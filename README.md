## Abstract

One great challenge in neuroscience is connecting molecular and cellular phenotypes to behavioral consequences. Social motivation exhibits individual trait variation. We hypothesized that proportion or molecular features of hypothalamic neurons can predict individual differences in behavior. To test this, we generated single-nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles of >120,000 neurons from the tuberal hypothalamus and adjacent thalamus from 36 mice assessed for social motivation, balanced across sex and autism-associated mutation. We show that single-neuronal activity patterns reliably predict behavior across individuals, while natural variation in neuronal proportions—likely arising from stochastic developmental events—is sufficient to profoundly shape adult behavior, even among genetically-identical individuals. Analysis of immediate-early gene patterns revealed that PVN Agtr1a+ neuronal activity negatively predicts social behavior, supported by FDA-approved AGTR1A antagonists increasing social orienting. Next, we identified multiple neuronal populations whose relative abundance correlated with social reward-seeking. Chemogenetic inhibition of one such population, Nxph4+ neurons of the posterior and lateral hypothalamus, suppressed multiple aspects of social motivation. These results reveal that stochastic variations in neuronal architecture deterministically influence behavior, with implications beyond social motivation to phenomena like stress susceptibility and addiction vulnerability. Overall, this work establishes a proof-of-principle for using single-cell genomics to identify neural substrates of behavior, while revealing cellular determinants of social motivation that suggest therapeutic avenues for disorders with social deficits.
